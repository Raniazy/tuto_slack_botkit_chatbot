# tuto_slack_botkit_chatbot
This is a tutorial for building a slack chatbot using botkit. 

I love [Slack](https://slack.com/). I's my favorite meeting chat room. My interest in bots leaded me to write this tutorial where you'll see how simple it is to build your own chatbot in slack.

A bot is a piece of software designed to execute scripts to automate tasks that you would normally do on your own, such as make a dinner reservation, or update calendar appointment information. 
Often deployed inside messaging apps, chatbots are a popular way of handling customer service requests.
[Slack](https://slack.com/) has been interested in chatbots a while now.
